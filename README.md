# CaveDwellers_Unity

Unity3D port of SenneGame (2D). This is my first attempt to create a Unity3D game.

It's a top down 'shooter' with similarities to classic RPG's but a little different. I keep experimenting and see where it goes.

As for the controls, I'm currently experimenting with common FPS controls. For some this may be awkward, but for others it seems to be quite handy ...
